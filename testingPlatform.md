# The Testing Platform
If you are interested in the sharing GPUs between Pods, please contact ta.yeh@lsalab.cs.nthu.edu.tw.

## WARNING
It's dangerous to put your critical contents in the testing platform. Basically, having the right to manipulate Pods is to have the permission for accessing the host and everything.

## Accessing Kubernetes
A file located at ```~/.kube/config``` is configured to access Kubernetes.
